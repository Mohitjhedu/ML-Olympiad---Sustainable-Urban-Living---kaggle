# ML-Olympiad---Sustainable-Urban-Living---kaggle
 ML model that predicts the Sustainable Habitability Score of a property based on the provided data.
 
Finding a suitable place to live is a crucial decision, significantly impacting your well-being. While online listings provide information, it can be challenging to assess a property's true "habitability" based solely on descriptions. This is where AI can lend a helping hand!


## Overview 
This competition invites to leverage Machine Learning techniques to develop a model that predicts the habitability score of a property based on available details. Model will contribute to a user-friendly system that empowers individuals to make informed decisions about their living spaces. #MLOlympiad

### Goal: Develop an ML model that predicts the Sustainable Habitability Score of a property based on the provided data.

## Evaluation
Your model's performance will be evaluated based on its ability to accurately predict habitability scores. The primary metric for evaluation will be the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) But we also Choose (MAE) Mean Absolute Error.
